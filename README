Package ebnf is a library for EBNF grammars salvaged from pre Go 1 exp/ebnf as
other packages at github.com/cznic used to depend on it.

This fork adds literal regular expression support in the EBNF grammar, so that
a complete grammar with terminal definitions is possible.

Install: $ go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/ebnf
